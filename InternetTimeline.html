From the controlled environment of the laboratories to our homes our ideas travel through design. Design projects ideas into the future. It uses knowledge, it creates new knowledge, and it brings together intuition, instinct and intent. It involves creativity. It involves taking decisions and responsibility. <br>
        <br>
        The purpose of communication design, an important aspect of communication is to be able to deal with oneself and challenges of the new era. Our relationship with ourselves is shaped through our communication with the reality around us.  Today, as more and more of us become star performers in our own story, as we project ourselves into the world through mass media devices and show off our harvest of 'likes' we are at once the performer and the audience. We are the communicators and the communicated. In this wonderful scenario it is all the more important to look closely at what we communicate, why we communicate, how we communicate and to whom we communicate.  <br>
        <br>
        We shall be locating the design of communication through several theories, practical lessons in perspectives, clay modeling, painting, photography, video, fonts and typography, and in the Natyashastra. It is the purpose of communication design to shape information, to control and direct its flow, to sharpen its tools like language, sound and gesture, to create and shape knowledge and finally the attitudes and the behavior of people and institutions.  Why do we do that? Because we have to engage with ourselves, our bodies, our minds, our intellect, our spirit as much as and at times more so than the world that is 'outside' our being. We seek to communicate so that we can be silent – fearless and free. .<br>
